Python Web Scraping Project for sentimental analysis.

A Python-based web scraping solution to extract, clean, and structure content from multiple websites, including Wikipedia and online articles. This project demonstrates practical usage of BeautifulSoup and Requests libraries for web data extraction and handling diverse HTML structures.

Features & Workflow

HTML Parsing & Data Retrieval: Extract structured and unstructured data such as headings (h1), language sections, paragraphs, and article content.

Dynamic Page Handling: Scrape multiple web pages (Wikipedia, news/blog articles) using tag-based and class-based extraction (find_all, find).

Automated Data Collection: Reusable functions to scrape entire page content and save locally in text files for large-scale collection.

Error Handling & Robustness: Ensures scraping continues even if HTML structures are unexpected or elements are missing.

Content Preprocessing: Cleans and formats raw HTML by stripping tags and whitespace for ready-to-use data.

Examples

Extracted main headings and language options from Wikipedia.

Scraped and saved the entire content of the Wikipedia page on Data Science.

Extracted articles from external blogs, handling both article tags and specific div containers.

Technical Skills Demonstrated

Python, BeautifulSoup, Requests, HTML parsing, file handling, data preprocessing, web automation.

Outcome

This project highlights the ability to efficiently gather, process, and store web-based information, essential for data-driven research, analytics, and decision-making.
